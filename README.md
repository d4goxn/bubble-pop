# BubblePop

A simple game for kids, by Sraemech and Dan.

Check it out at http://bubble-pop.aws.af.cm/

## Setup

To run this app locally, install the dependencies and start the server:

```
npm install
node server.js
```

## Contributing

To hack on the code, use the [fork and pull](https://github.com/sevntu-checkstyle/sevntu.checkstyle/wiki/Development-workflow-with-Git%3A-Fork,-Branching,-Commits,-and-Pull-Request) workflow.

If you have assets that should be incorporated into the game, and the above method is not convenient for you, just message me and I will add them and thank you :)

## Testing

To run the test suite, install Karma and start the testing server.

```
npm install -g karma
karma start
```
